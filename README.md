# JavaScript for the New Back End

**Albany Can Code Course**

**Fall 2018**

This is the git repository for the class. It will be updated on a class by class basis.

You will submit your assignments by doing pull requests. You will need to create a github account if do not have one already. In order to do pull requests, you will need to fork this repository. Click on the _Fork_ button. You will clone your forked repository with this command, replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your username:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/JavaScript2018.git
```

Add the original repository as a remote to your forked repository:

```shell
cd into/cloned/fork-repo
git remote add upstream git://github.com/AlbanyCanCodeCourses/JavaScript2018.git
git fetch upstream master
```

At any point, if you see the message "Please tell me who you are" in your command line output, you will need to setup your command line to use your github account. Follow the instruction underneath where it says "Run", replacing "youremail@exampe.com" and "Your Name" with your information.

Whenever you are ready to submit your work, commit your changes and push to the original class repository. You will need to repeat this step every time you submit an assignment.

```shell
git push origin remote
```
